  <h1>Why Custom Skills Don't Load in OpenClaw - A Known Bug</h1>

    <p><strong>This post was co-created with Clawsistant, my OpenClaw AI agent. Because sometimes the best way to explain your career path is to have an AI help you connect the dots.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I've been building my AI assistant setup with OpenClaw, and recently tried to create a custom "blog-publishing" skill to automate my workflow. After spending hours configuring everything, I discovered it simply doesn't work—and it's not just me.</p>
  
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>OpenClaw's skill system allows you to extend your agent with custom skills. According to the docs, you can place custom skills in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/</code> (highest priority)</li>
    <li><code>~/.openclaw/skills/</code> (shared across agents)</li>
    <li>Extra directories via <code>skills.load.extraDirs</code> in config</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>But when I placed my custom skill there and restarted the gateway, it never appeared in the skills list. Only the bundled skills (5 out of 51) loaded.</p>
  
  <h2>It's a Known Bug</h2>
  <p>After some research, I found <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/10386">GitHub Issue #10386</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The agent is unable to discover or register custom skills located in the workspace or defined via extraDirs. While the agent can 'see' the files via directory listing commands in a chat session, the system registry fails to ingest them, only showing the 50 default bundled skills."</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>This bug affects multiple users running different setups (Docker, bare metal, various Linux distributions). The issue has been open since version 2026.2.3-1, and persists in the latest version (2026.2.22-2 as of this writing).</p>
  
  <h2>Current Workarounds</h2>
  <p>While waiting for a fix, here's what works:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Manual execution:</strong> Keep your skill as documentation and manually follow the steps when needed</li>
    <li><strong>Use bundled skills only:</strong> Stick to the 5 ready-to-use skills (healthcheck, skill-creator, tmux, video-frames, weather)</li>
    <li><strong>Subscribe to the issue:</strong> Track #10386 for updates</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>Custom skills are essential for power users who want to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automate personal workflows</li>
    <li>Create domain-specific knowledge</li>
    <li>Build reusable agent behaviors</li>
    <li>Share configurations across agents</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Without custom skills, OpenClaw becomes much less customizable. I hope this gets fixed soon—it's a critical feature for the platform's extensibility.</p>
  
  <h2>What I Did</h2>
  <p>Despite the bug, I created my blog-publishing skill anyway:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Documented all steps in <code>SKILL.md</code></li>
    <li>Added the skill to <code>~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/blog-publishing/</code></li>
    <li>Manually follow the steps when publishing blog posts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>It works—you're reading this blog post! But it's not as elegant as it should be.</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>If you're trying to create custom skills in OpenClaw and they're not loading, you're not crazy. It's a known bug (#10386). Star the issue to show support for a fix.</p>
  
  <p>Has anyone found a workaround? Let me know in the comments.</p>
